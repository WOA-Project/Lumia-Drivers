Please make sure your battery is fully charged before installing this driver pack. For most batteries the charge must be 100% as the phone may shutdown during setup if the battery is even at 80% charge.
Make sure battery is charged to 100% before continuing. If this is not the case, reboot your device **now** and charge it in an **Operating System**.

Reminder: if you are using WOA Deployer, **please** do not use the "Force Dual Boot" button, otherwise the setup process
will FAIL.

How to offline update an existing Windows Desktop installation

- Switch the device into mass storage.
- Take note of the drive letter the Windows partition is using, here we will assume it got mounted as X:

- Download [Lumia-Drivers-Full.zip] from https://github.com/WOA-Project/Lumia-Drivers/releases/latest
- Extract said zip file to a folder of your choice, we will assume here we extracted it to \<path to extracted drivers\>
- Download the DriverUpdater utility from https://github.com/WOA-Project/DriverUpdater/releases/latest
- Open a command prompt as administrator, where the driver utility got downloaded

- If your device is a Lumia 950, execute the following command:
  
```
DriverUpdater.exe -d "<path to extracted drivers>\definitions\Desktop\ARM64\Internal\950.txt" -r "<path to extracted drivers>" -p X:\
```

- If your device is a Lumia 950 XL, execute the following command:
  
```
DriverUpdater.exe -d "<path to extracted drivers>\definitions\Desktop\ARM64\Internal\950xl.txt" -r "<path to extracted drivers>" -p X:\
```

- Reboot the device, the device will now begin PnP setup once again, and hopefully you will be back soon enough to your desktop

How to install Windows Desktop on an SD card

NOTE: It is also possible to put the UEFI and bootshim on the sd card, but steps are not detailed here. Short Version: 
Copy EFIESP to a new partition on your SD Card, edit BCD to remove WP boot entries and ensure bootshim/uefi is present. 
In order to boot from the SD Card EFIESP press volume down at boot of your device with the sd card inserted.

- Insert your SD Card
- Install Windows on the SD card like you would on any external storage media (some tools even exist that can do it for you ie Rufus)
- Set TestSigning on the {bootloadersettings} object of BCD on the sd card
- Setup BootShim/Lumia950XlPkg on the phone eMMC like you would on a traditional installation
  (You can download bootshim from here: https://dev.azure.com/LumiaWoA/Boot%20Shim/_build/results?buildId=174&view=results)
  (and the UEFI from here: https://github.com/WOA-Project/Lumia950XLPkg/releases)
- Take note of the drive letter the Windows partition is using on the sd card, here we will assume it got mounted as X:

- Download [Lumia-Drivers-Full.zip] from https://github.com/WOA-Project/Lumia-Drivers/releases/latest
- Extract said zip file to a folder of your choice, we will assume here we extracted it to \<path to extracted drivers\>
- Download the DriverUpdater utility from https://github.com/WOA-Project/DriverUpdater/releases/latest
- Open a command prompt as administrator, where the driver utility got downloaded

- If your device is a Lumia 950, execute the following command:

```
DriverUpdater.exe -d "<path to extracted drivers>\definitions\Desktop\ARM64\SDCard\950.txt" -r "<path to extracted drivers>" -p X:\
```

- If your device is a Lumia 950 XL, execute the following command:

```
DriverUpdater.exe -d "<path to extracted drivers>\definitions\Desktop\ARM64\SDCard\950xl.txt" -r "<path to extracted drivers>" -p X:\
```

- Reboot the device, boot into BootShim, let the UEFI load, and you should be able to boot from SD Card.

Surface Pen Support

Surface Pen Support in the Digitizer driver has been enabled in this release. It may work with other pens but it has 
not been tested with others.

Currently the implementation requires you to reflash the digitizer firmware to one with pen functionality enabled. 
Unfortunately such firmware is currently only available for the Lumia 950 (Talkman) device and not the Lumia 950 XL (Cityman)

To learn more on how to reflash such firmware and thus enable pen support, please go to the following message:

https://t.me/LumiaWOA_Announcements/364


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Note on the Power Engine Plugin (PEP) support for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 Processor (MSM8992)

Currently PEP only manages properly the first cluster A53. The Second Cluster is not getting faster clock speeds due to 
overclocking issues in the driver. Normally the A53 cluster should be running at 1.48Ghz instead of 1.53Ghz as well.
The overclocking issue in PEP makes the A57 cluster run at 1.96Ghz instead of 1.87Ghz leading to a platform crash during
boot. Parking is functional for both clusters in this release. Only higher clock speeds is incorrectly done.

Please do not apply previous workarounds from the past, they are not compatible with this release.

Hardware specific defects

- A considerable amount of Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL devices do not work with the HP lapdock properly when using a wired connection

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


General software defects

- Plugging an iPhone into the USB C port of the device will result in a power delivery negotiation loop
- Cameras are not available
- Windows Hello Iris Scanner is not available
- Hyper-V is not available
- SD Card Boot is not available
- Battery life is degraded
- GPS stack is not using any sensor for navigation
- Miracast is not functional with many wireless devices, but works fine on Xbox, and Windows 10 computers
- Graphical glitches can be observed with acrylic effects on builds lower or equal than 20100
- Graphical glitches can be observed on shadows
- MTP may fail to start if the device is plugged a second time if the NcsdService is enabled, stop the NcsdService to fix the issue via task manager
- Dual SIM devices are unsupported for Cellular, do not expect cellular to work properly on these
- DirectX is unavailable for x86 and amd64 applications
- Microphone level under Settings is stuck at 50%
- Phone may not boot reliably or have random reboots when the battery falls below 50% on certain devices, if all cores are enabled. Especially if the battery is counterfeit or worn out.
  As a workaround, you can run "bcdedit /set numproc 4" to disable the second core cluster

- No VoLTE
- No VoWiFi
- No Cellular data sharing
- Phone Calls require manual provisioning by the user on builds higher than 18908
- Text messages are unavailable on builds higher then 18908
- Some users might end up being unable to send texts on build 18908 and lower. To address this issue, open regedit on
  the device, go to HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Messaging\IMEISpecific (or IMSISpecific), right click, go to security
  Tap advanced, tap change owner, in the dialog that opens, enter "Everyone" (without the quotes), tap check names
  press ok, press ok. Tap ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES, select 'full control', do the same for other listed accounts (optionally)
  Apply, and close regedit.
- An APN might be required to specify for some users in order to get cellular data working.

- Cellular is unavailable on builds lower than 17672.
- Some drivers and mainly sensors will not be working on RS3 (16299).

- Current issues with glance screen:

When the glance screen times out after the time specified there's a chance the screen won't turn off, this is still needing investigation but the issue can only be two things:
- either the device got out of S0ix and is sleeping at a lower level, because wifi is not connected for example, as a result the glance service is unable to take actions, this is a problem
- or, the glance service is trying to clear the screen, (there's a specific panel driver command to do so), and for some reason this is failing.
This specific issue might take some time to completely iron out.

The following status notifications are not implemented in the port/non functional in the wrapper libraries:
- Battery saver indication
- Ringer indication (vibrate on, silence on)
- Alarm indication
- Detailed text indication
- Notification badges

The following functionality is not implemented:
- Wake glance on single tap

Deprecation notice

- Support for Build 18363 has ended, we cannot guarentee anymore that things will continue to work due to ongoing testing being halted.
  18363 and lower are over 3 years old. Please upgrade to 19041 or higher.

- Night light is broken on 18363 and lower [Won't fix, <= 18363 is deprecated, see above]

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Windows 10/11 software defects

- Applications do not get installed if the user reboots the device on first boot before completion or if the date and time settings are incorrect during OOBE (Out Of Box Experience).
  As a workaround, find the "Second Party Application Provisioner" application in the start menu, right click, run as administrator
- System reset is not supported
- First boot can have bad thermal performance due to Windows initial app installation.
  While leaving the phone plugged in to a wall charger, let it install all applications, all app updates through the store, and OneDrive. Then let the phone cool down

Windows 10X software defects

NOTE: Windows 10X is a dead Operating System currently and we have no plans to offer images ourselves anymore. We believe those who still want to go this way should be able
      to build an image themselves with the content we provide under the adaptationkit directory.

- Vibration is unavailable
- Under certain circumstances, Windows may fail booting on talkman devices when AutoChk runs (repairing drive at boot). If this is your case, let the device reboot a couple of times, or reflash the FFU file til the issue vanishes
- Second Party Apps are not available
- Cellular data is unavailable
